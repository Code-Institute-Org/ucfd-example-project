# Haley Schafer Portfolio
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The portfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. As I am bilingual, it has both an English and a French version.


## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://hschafer2017.github.io/HSCHAFER-Portfolio/).

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was chosen to create a sleek and modern feel. 

For employers, I wanted to provide them with a brief overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly design. This way, they would be able to get a glimpse of who I am, my background, work I've done, and my skills, with the option to contact me if they choose. In the 'Work/Travail' section, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, providing a short summary of the project and main technologies with a link to each GitHub Repository and live demo. A link to my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub, and a downloadable PDF version of my CV were also provided for their ease of access. 


## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)


## Features
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap with an extra JavaScript function added to create a 'smooth scrolling' effect. The navbar also stays collapsed regardless of the screen size to promote a minimalist design.


### Features Left to Implement 
In the future, I would like to add further projects that I've worked on to create a more comprehensive 'work/travail' section. I would like to also add animations to the progress circles in the "skills/compétences" section to animate in some way on hover. 


## Testing 
If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. If all field are valid, the page will reload. 

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download to your default folder for downloads on click using the 'download' attribute. 

By clicking on the links in the navbar, the scrollSpy effect will work regardless of whether or not you're viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar. 

This site was tested across multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized that ```background-attachment: fixed``` was not compatible with iOS browsers. On Chrome and Safari in iOS, the background photos appeared zoomed-in and blurry. To fix this, the ```background-attachment: scroll``` property value was added in a media query. 


## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.

### Content
All content in the "About Me/À Propos" and "Work/Travail" sections in this portfolio site were written by me. 

### Media 
All photos were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/), a stock image library, with the exception of the photo of myself in the background of the 'about me/À Propos' section in the desktop view. A greyscale filter was applied to each one prior to upload to preserve the greyscale theme. 

### Acknowledgements 
The scrollSpy delay JavaScript function was found through this tutorial [here](https://www.abeautifulsite.net/smoothly-scroll-to-an-element-without-a-jquery-plugin-2). 

The progress circles from the skills section are modeled after the following Stack Overflow [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14222138/css-progress-circle). They were significantly modified to fit the styling, sizing, and progress for each skill. 

The media query for the collapsed navbar regardless of viewport width was taken from this [site](https://www.codeply.com/go/iaM1zcNsQB/bootstrap-navbar-always-collapsed).
