# Haley Schafer Portfolio
Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is a portfolio website to present to prospective employers. The porfolio highlights six projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form. As I am bilingual, it has both an English and a French version.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here](https://hschafer2017.github.io/HSCHAFER-Portfolio/). 

## UX
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site, while striving for a minimalist design. The greyscale color scheme was choosen to create a sleek and modern feel. 

For employers, I wanted them to be able to quickly access work that I've done, via the skill cards in the 'Work' sections, while also being able to view my CV.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap

## Features

### Features Left to Implement 

## Testing 
If you try to submit the contact form with an invalid email address, there will be an error noting the invalid email address. Furthermore, the 'required' attribute is added to the 'name,' 'email,' and 'message' fields, so if those fields are not filled in, the form will not submit. 

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download to your default folder for downloads on click using the 'download' attribute. 

By clicking on the links in the navbar, the scrollSpy effect will work regardless of whether or not you're viewing the sections in the same order they are listed in the dropdown navbar. 

## Deployment 
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch.
